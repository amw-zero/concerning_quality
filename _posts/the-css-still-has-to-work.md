When I first created this blog, I jotted down a few words, tweaked the prebuilt theme to my liking a bit, and finally pushed it to production. In some delicious irony (this is a blog about software quality after all), the styles were completely missing. Something about the static site build resulted in different local and production directory structures, so the assets couldn't be found.

Have you ever seen an [unstyled webpage](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes/)? If you're lucky, the content is still readable. But a lot is missing: your design system, your colors, your visual identity. It just doesn't feel right.

Sometimes we are a little too bullish about the representation of software as a purely mathematical-local system. I fall into this trap all the time. Software is still a product, and still used by people. UX matters. Presentation matters. Colors matter. Style matters.

Well, I never shy away from building UI and frontend development. It's an integral part of a product

So I propose a mantra for the quality and verification community and enthusiasts alike:

The CSS still has to work.

What use is an application that can't be interacted with?
